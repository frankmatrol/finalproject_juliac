This is my Mini game tournament I developed for the final culmination project for grade 12 Java. Two players compete in each game for points and the final score is shown at the end of the tournament.

**Games List:**
1. Trivia (all new)
1. Rock Paper Scissors *(modified from my project 1)
1. Memory *(modified from my project 2)
1. TicTacToe *(modified from my Project 3)

\* These games were modified for 2 player and some (Rock paper scissors & Memory) were also made into classes. TicTacToe was already class based.

Check list:
1. MVP needs to compile and meet all the minimum requirements from Part 1 : **DONE**
2. compound data types other than strings : **DONE**
3. compound data types other than arrays : **DONE**
4. object-oriented? : **DONE**
   - (all files are classes, interfaces or enumerations that use aggregation, composition or inheritance)
6. time- and space-efficient algorithms : **DONE**
    - looping through unsorted lists O(N) or linear time
    - list aren't doubled or duplicated
